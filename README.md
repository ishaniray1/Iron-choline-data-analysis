# Iron–Choline Data Analysis

This repository contains R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files and R scripts used for analyzing the relationship between **iron intake/status**, **choline intake**, and **geriatric cognition** across multiple large-scale population datasets.

## Datasets Used
- **NHANES** (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)
- **UK Biobank**
- **Framingham Heart Study (FHS)**

These datasets were harmonized and processed to evaluate nutritional biomarkers, dietary intake, and cognitive outcomes in older adults.

## Included Components
### **R Markdown Files (`/rmd/`)**
- End-to-end analysis workflows
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model fitting (regression, mixed models)
- Sensitivity analyses across datasets

### **R Scripts (`/scripts/`)**
- Data cleaning + preprocessing
- Feature harmonization across datasets
- Variable construction (iron biomarkers, choline intake levels, cognition scores)
- Statistical modeling functions

## Ongoing Work
  
## Research Objective
To examine whether interactions between **iron biomarkers** , **dietary iron intake**  and **dietary choline intake** are associated with **cognitive performance** in older adults, using complementary population cohorts.
